# Basics of Adding and Committing.
 - A commit - a checkpoint in time, snapshot of changes in the repo.

 Commit process records snapshots of your project at various stages allowing you to:
 - Track progress.
 - Revert Changes.
 - Collaborate with others efficiently. 

 ## Git Repo

 Works place that tracks and manages files within a folder.

 Using git with a project we need to create a repository.

 - A project can only have 1 git repo.

 ### Creating/Initializing a git repo.

 ```
 git init
 ```
 - A git repo is initialized in the project folder.
 - where it will track and manage changes.

 Use:
 ```
 git status
 ```
 to confirm if your project has a git repo or not.

 ### Adding Changes to the Staging Area
 ```
 git add FILE_NAME
 ```
 Example:
 ```
 git add chapter1.txt
 ```

 Add multiple files by listing all of them: 

 ```
 git add chapter1.txt chapter2.txt chapter3.txt
 ```
 Adding all files in one go using `.` or `-A`

 ```
 git add .
 ```
 or
 ```
 git add -A
 ```
